    <h1>PRIVACY WTF</h1>

    <p>
      AQI WTF is a non-commercial project. We just want it to be easier for you
      to know the air quality outside your location.
    </p>

    <p>
      We collect limited analytical data about your use of this site with
      <a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible.io</a>. You can read about why
      they're relatively privacy-forward on their website. Of course, if you're
      using an ad blocker or anti-tracking tool, it's probably blocking Plausible.
      That's cool.
    </p>

    <p>
      This tool uses data from PurpleAir's sensor network, which they make freely
      available. Your browser will connect to their servers to download a list of
      all available sensors. Your browser will then ask your device for your
      current location. Using these two bits of data, AQI WTF will figure out the
      closest Purple Air sensor and download air quality information from Purple
      Air. While you have the app open, this process will repeat about once a
      minute, to ensure that you aren't looking at stale air quality
      information.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>AQI WTF does not store your current location.</strong>
      Instead, it asks your browser where you are whenever it needs to show you
      the current air quality.
      <strong>
        AQI WTF does not send your current location to us or any third party.
      </strong>
      We do not want to know where you are. We just want you to be able to
      breathe.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you don't want to let AQI WTF know your current location, that's 100%
      cool with us. But it means that the site won't work.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>
        AQI WTF does send a request to Purple Air once a minute. That request
        includes the sensor closest to your current location.
      </strong>
      In theory, this means Purple Air could track your location. We don't think
      they do (or that they care to), but we don't have any kind of a business
      relationship with them so can't make any promises on their behalf.
    </p>

    <p>
      AQI WTF is written in a programming language called JavaScript and runs
      entirely on your device. If you have questions or concerns about how it
      works, all the source code for the app is freely available on GitHub at
      <a href="https://github.com/skalnik/aqi-wtf">https://github.com/skalnik/aqi-wtf</a>.
